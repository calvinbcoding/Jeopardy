# Jeopardy

## MVP:
You have been chosen to compete in coding jeopardy with Alex Trebech!! Use CSS grid to create your columns and rows. The Three categories are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (what a coincidence). Under each category the questions start at $100 and increase with dificulty until they reach $500. The questions will be true/false. Win by reaching $1000.

### Extras:
-Make questions mustiple choice

-Make class constructor to allow several players

-Instead of winning automatically when a player reaches $1000 they wil be allowed to choose between three doors, each door has a different outcome: it could be a prize, it could be a "restart at $0" function, or it could be a -$x dollars from player's total $1000 (not as severe as starting over).

-Add an extra category of jQuery
