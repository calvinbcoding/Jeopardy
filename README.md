# Jeopardy

## MVP:
You have been chosen to compete in coding jeopardy with Alex Trebech!! Create a set of at least 3 categories and 3 questions per subject. The Three categories are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (what a coincidence). Under each category the questions start at $100 and increase with difficulty as the dollar amount rewarded increases. The questions will be true/false. Win by reaching $1000.

### Extras:
-Make questions multiple choice.

-Increase the amount of questions.

-Increase the amount of categories (jQuery).

-Make class constructor to allow several players.

-Instead of calculating points with a counter, use jQuery to asses if an answer was correct or not and award or subtract points automatically.

-Instead of winning automatically when a player reaches $1000 they wil be allowed to choose between three doors, each door has a different outcome: it could be a prize, it could be a "restart at $0" function, or it could be a -$x dollars from player's total $1000 (not as severe as starting over).

-Add audio (jeopardy theme song).
