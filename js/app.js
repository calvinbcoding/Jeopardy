// // 1. Create a grid:
// //  with -three columns and 
// //       -6 rows (5 rows for $100-$500, and a header row).

// 2. the header row should have 3 columns: HTML, CSS, JS
// 3. the columns themselves should be $100-$500 (based on dificulty)
//     -row 1 = headers 
//     -row 2 = $100 questions
//     -row 3 = $200 questions
//     -row 4 = $300 questions
//     -row 5 = $400 questions
//     -row 6 = $500 questions
// 4. when a player chooses a category and row, clicking on that square should reveal a 
// question with t/f or multiple choice answers built into the square -(this could also 
//     be a prompt), or a new screen entirely

// 5. a second click should reveal either on one of the multiple choice answers or on a t/f 
// prompt should award the correct amount of $ to the player

// 6. a. a correct answer will add the $ amount to the player's score and remove the 
//         question from the grid/table
//     b. an incorrect answer will: 1.subtract the amounT OF $ the question was worth from
//                                     the players' $/score
//                         ### extra 2. an incorrect answer will move onto the next player

// 7.
